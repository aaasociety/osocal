Abdul's OSO produkter!

The most significant of these products are the calview.py program!
I think the codebase is quite elegant and I have spent a lot of time refining it and making it as bug-free as can be! 

## Calendar format

This program uses an internal calendar format which you can edit using the "caledit.py" program and you can read it using "calview.py"
