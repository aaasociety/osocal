# osocal!

A simple Python app!

## What is this mess?

This is a calendar app coded in Python, it was used for a school project that is long-gone.

To see the calendar app for yourself, run the calview.py program. Don't be surprised if it does not work.

You can use this as a calendar app, the author uses a customized version as his go-to calendar app

## Why not rewrite it?

A rewrite would be nice but none of us know any other programming languages other than Python.

Maybe we can take a look at Nim? it has a ncurses module...
